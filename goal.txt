Next goals: 
  Take a pass for now --> Create a Component that owns a Scribble and a StylePicker and wires StylePicker events into the Scribble
  --> actually unnecessary. serialize method for entire drawings
  Add undo and the requisite `visibleUntil` property needed to support it
  Animate multiple drawings in sequence (events on end of animation)
  Add drawing functionality for a "table view" or "race view" w/ panning, zooming
