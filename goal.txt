Little fix:
  round line cap, round line join for big canvas

Next goals: 
  Add back in the local storage save capability to test serialization
  Add undo and the requisite `visibleUntil` property needed to support it
  ^-- not actually the approach worth taking.
  Painter has
    canonical representation of drawing; how drawing will be saved and transmitted
    playback representation of drawing; all strokes and undos, times scaled for playback
    intermediate representation of drawing:
      call method to indicate that you are starting animation of the drawing
       ---> side effects creating new empty intermediate representation
      call method indicating the time at which the drawing will next be painted
      ---> walk playback representation: 
        process every item that starts between the last update time and the new one:
          replays are added as "pushes".
          undos are executed as "pops".  

  In creating a drawing, undos push an undo onto the canonical representation and thus pop a replay off
  the actual painting; redos pop an undo off the canonical representation IFF the last item in the
  canonical representation is an undo.  Because redos remove the original undo from the canonical
  representation, undoing and redoing one or more times WILL NOT APPEAR IN THE PLAYBACK.

  Alternative: can we allow people to be really annoying and undo/redo things multiple times?  well, if
  we're taking the time to make undos behave nicely with this whole canonical/playback/intermediate
  representation, it may be worth doing as it won't make things that much MORE complicated...

  Animate multiple drawings in sequence (events on end of animation)
  Add drawing functionality for a "table view" or "race view" w/ panning, zooming
