Next goals: 
much further along  Wire all that shit up
  Add undo and the requisite `visibleUntil` property needed to support it
  (redo?) <-- no, no, thirteen times no.
  Animate multiple drawings in sequence (events on end of animation)
  Add drawing functionality for a "table view" or "race view" w/ panning, zooming


Next steps?:
  serialize method for entire drawings
CHECK!  color / linewidth controls
CHECK!  erase method
CHECK!  polyline fill


Current way of painting shit onto stylepicker canvases is awkward.
FIXED dat shit
