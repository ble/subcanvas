Next goals: 
  Add more drawing methods (flesh out polyline, polyline fill, erase)
  Add componentry for colors, linewidths, method selection
    Use pixel coordinates for the icons
  Wire all that shit up
  Add undo and the requisite `visibleUntil` property needed to support it
  (redo?) <-- no, no, thirteen times no.
  Animate multiple drawings in sequence (events on end of animation)
  Add drawing functionality for a "table view" or "race view" w/ panning, zooming
