Next goals: 
  Add more drawing methods (flesh out polyline, polyline fill, erase)
  Add componentry for colors, linewidths, method selection
    Use pixel coordinates for the icons
  Wire all that shit up
  Add undo and the requisite `visibleUntil` property needed to support it
  (redo?) <-- no, no, thirteen times no.
  Animate multiple drawings in sequence (events on end of animation)
  Add drawing functionality for a "table view" or "race view" w/ panning, zooming


Progress:
  Added polyline serialization and deserialization
  tested out polyline motion capture with componentry
  change motion capture listeners in component

Next steps?:
  Extend new styling approach to polyline
  Record representative paths for icon use
  icons for method selection
  serialize method for entire drawings
  erase method
  color / linewidth controls + polyline fill
