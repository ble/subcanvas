Next goals: 
in progress Add more drawing methods (flesh out polyline, polyline fill, erase)
CHECK!  Add componentry for colors, linewidths, method selection
CHECK!    Use pixel coordinates for the icons
in progress  Wire all that shit up
  Add undo and the requisite `visibleUntil` property needed to support it
  (redo?) <-- no, no, thirteen times no.
  Animate multiple drawings in sequence (events on end of animation)
  Add drawing functionality for a "table view" or "race view" w/ panning, zooming


Next steps?:
  serialize method for entire drawings
  color / linewidth controls
  erase method
  polyline fill


Current way of painting shit onto stylepicker canvases is awkward.
